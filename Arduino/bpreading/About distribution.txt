Use PyInstaller to pack all the dependency modules and files into one exe file. 

If you don't have the PyInstaller module, please run following: 
pip install pyinstaller

Then, please cd to the dir of run.py

pyinstaller -F run.py

-F means only 1 exe remained
there will be 2 folders named dist and build
and 1 file named run.spec

you only need to copy the dist folder to user's window pc
